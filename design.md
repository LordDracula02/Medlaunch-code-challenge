## Overview

This document outlines the design decisions, architecture, and implementation details for the Reports Management System backend API. The system is built with Node.js, TypeScript, and Express.js, following production-quality standards with comprehensive business rules and security measures.

## Schema and Data Model

### Core Entities

#### User
```typescript
interface User {
  id: string;                    // UUID primary key
  email: string;                 // Unique email address
  name: string;                  // Display name
  role: UserRole;                // READER, EDITOR, ADMIN
  tier: UserTier;                // DEFAULT, PREMIUM
  password: string;              // bcrypt hashed
  storageUsed: number;           // Current storage usage in bytes
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}
```

#### Report
```typescript
interface Report {
  id: string;                    // UUID primary key
  title: string;                 // Report title
  description: string;           // Report description
  status: ReportStatus;          // DRAFT, ACTIVE, ARCHIVED, DELETED
  priority: ReportPriority;      // LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, CRITICAL
  createdBy: string;             // User ID of creator
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
  lastModifiedBy: string;        // User ID of last modifier
  lastModifiedAt: Date;
  collaborators: string[];       // Array of user IDs

  entries: ReportEntry[];        // Nested entries collection
  comments: ReportComment[];     // Nested comments collection
  tags: string[];                // Array of tags
  metadata: Record<string, any>; // Flexible metadata object
  version: number;               // Optimistic concurrency control
  isActive: boolean;             // Soft delete flag
}
```

#### ReportEntry
```typescript
interface ReportEntry {
  id: string;                    // UUID
  title: string;                 // Entry title

  metadata: Record<string, any>; // Entry metadata
}
```

#### Attachment
```typescript
interface Attachment {
  id: string;                    // UUID primary key
  reportId: string;              // Foreign key to report
  filename: string;              // Stored filename
  originalName: string;          // Original filename
  mimeType: string;              // File MIME type

  storagePath: string;           // File system path
  downloadUrl?: string;          // Optional signed URL
  expiresAt?: Date;              // URL expiration
  isActive: boolean;             // Soft delete flag
}
```

### Data Storage Strategy

**In-Memory Storage**: For this implementation, we use in-memory storage with Map objects to simulate a NoSQL/document-oriented database. This approach:

- Provides fast access for development and testing
- Eliminates database setup complexity
- Demonstrates the data model and relationships
- Can be easily replaced with MongoDB, PostgreSQL, or other databases

**Persistence Considerations**: In production, this would be replaced with:
- MongoDB for document storage
- PostgreSQL with JSONB for hybrid approach
- Redis for caching and session management
- Cloud storage (AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage) for file attachments

## Authentication and Authorization Model

### JWT-Based Authentication

**Token Structure**:
```typescript
interface JWTPayload {
  userId: string;
  email: string;
  role: UserRole;
  tier: UserTier;
  iat: number;    // Issued at
  exp: number;    // Expiration
}
```

**Security Features**:
- 15-minute access token expiration
- 7-day refresh token expiration
- bcrypt password hashing (12 salt rounds)
- Strong password validation
- Token blacklisting capability (for logout)

### Role-Based Access Control

**Role Hierarchy**:
1. **READER**: Can only read reports and attachments
2. **EDITOR**: Can read, create, and update reports and attachments
3. **ADMIN**: Full access to all resources and operations

**Permission Matrix**:
| Action | READER | EDITOR | ADMIN |
|--------|--------|--------|-------|
| Read Reports | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Create Reports | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Update Reports | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Delete Reports | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Upload Attachments | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Manage Users | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |

### Business Rule Integration

Authentication is tightly integrated with business rules:
- Storage quota enforcement during file uploads
- Report lifecycle management based on user roles
- Collaboration permissions for report editing
- Data retention policy enforcement

## Concurrency Control Approach

### Optimistic Concurrency Control

**Implementation**:
- Each report has a `version` field
- Clients must include the current version in update requests
- Server increments version on each update
- Conflicts are detected when version mismatch occurs

**Benefits**:
- No database locks required
- High performance for read-heavy workloads
- Natural conflict detection
- Works well with REST APIs

**Example Flow**:
1. Client reads report (version: 1)
2. Client modifies report locally
3. Client sends PUT request with version: 1
4. Server checks version, updates if match, increments to version: 2
5. If another client updated in between, conflict is detected

### Idempotency Support

**Implementation**:
- UUID-based idempotency keys via `Idempotency-Key` header
- LRU cache for storing request responses
- Cache expiration for memory management
- Automatic deduplication of identical requests

**Benefits**:
- Safe retry of failed requests
- Prevents duplicate resource creation
- Handles network timeouts gracefully
- Maintains data consistency

**Example Flow**:
1. Client sends PUT request with `Idempotency-Key: abc-123`
2. Server processes request and stores response in cache
3. If client retries with same key, server returns cached response
4. No duplicate processing occurs

**Cache Configuration**:
- Maximum 1000 cached responses
- 24-hour expiration for cached items
- Automatic cleanup of expired entries

### Concurrent Editor Management

**Business Rule**: Maximum 3 concurrent editors per report

**Implementation**:
- `concurrentEditors` array tracks active editors
- Editors are added when update begins
- Editors are removed when update completes or times out
- Business rule validation prevents exceeding limit

## File Storage and Access Security

### Storage Architecture

**Local File System** (Current Implementation):
- Files stored in `./uploads` directory
- Unique filenames generated using UUID
- Original filenames preserved in database
- File paths stored in database for retrieval

**Production Considerations**:
- Cloud storage (AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage)
- CDN integration for global access
- File encryption at rest
- Virus/malware scanning integration
- Automatic file lifecycle management

### Security Measures

**File Upload Validation**:
- File type validation (MIME type checking)
- File size limits (10MB default)
- Filename sanitization
- Storage quota enforcement per user

**Access Control**:
- Files tied to specific reports
- User must have access to report to view attachment metadata
- Download functionality: **FULLY IMPLEMENTED** ✅
- Signed URLs: **FULLY IMPLEMENTED** ✅
- Audit logging for upload and download operations

**Download Features**:
